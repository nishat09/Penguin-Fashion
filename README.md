Heart Disease Predictor Using Machine Learning.

We at first collected a dataset of 3000 patient from Kaggle having their medical records. The dataset had 14 features including one target column. On the pre processsing part, we did some data augmentation and took care of the nal values. We also made range for the columns having continuous values like age. Then we used various machine learning algortihms on the augmented dataset. We achieved highest accuracy using Logistic Regression which is 81%.
